    "\n",
    "We now know how to create graphs and do some basic querying and manipulation on them.  In this exercise we are going to get a bit more complicated.  In particular, we are going to explore some techniques to calculate the following:\n",

    "- Node similarity\n",
    "- PageRank\n",
    "- Community detection\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be working with the Wikidata knowledge graph to do this.  If you already have a Sandbox instance created with that graph, you can use that.  Otherwise there are cells below to get that built back up on a new instance.\n",

    "\n",
    "Similar to APOC, we will be using a different library to do these calculations: the [Graph Data Science Library](https://dev.neo4j.com/graph_data_science).  There are built-in functions to achieve each of these tasks that make things significantly easier.\n",

You will definitely want to consult the [documentation](https://neo4j.com/docs/graph-data-science/current/management-ops/) on this because the syntax can get involved.\n",

    "Well, let's start with a hypothesis.  I am going to hypothesize that the humans in the graph who go to the same university will be similar.  So we are going to create an in-memory graph exploring which nodes of type \"private university\" or \"graduate school\" the humans are connected to.  We will use the following query to do this:\n",
