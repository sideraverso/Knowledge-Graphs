    "# Exercise 2: Build your own knowledge graph with NLP\n",
    "\n",
    "## Don't worry!  An NLP workflow will be included here!\n",

    "There is a lot going on in this notebook.  We will walk through each step.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a lot of functions that get the search data into a format that can be uploaded into the graph.  As with any NLP project, there is a lot of preprocessing that needs to happen before you even worry about creating the graph.  And as we discussed, there is no proverbial \"silver bullet\" when it comes to NLP.  \n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise we will be creating the (subject, verb, object) triples.  From a broad brush-strokes perspective, this is what our NLP workflow will look like:\n",

    "## `Spacy`\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve the above, we will us the NLP package `spacy`.  It has a lot of great, basic functionality, especially when we are talking about detecting the parts of speech and identifying the ROOT.  But of course, you can choose to use anything you are comfortable with!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### A note about language models and configuring `spacy`\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use, just a little bit, the word vectors generated by `spacy`.  There are plenty of corpuses available from `spacy`.  We are going to use the medium-sized web corpus called `en_core_web_md`, which you can read about [here](https://spacy.io/models/en#en_core_web_md). The basic model is their small core library, taken from the web: `en_core_web_sm`, which provides good, basic functionality with a small download size (< 20 MB). However, one drawback of this basic model is that it doesn't have full word vectors. Instead, it comes with context-sensitive tensors. You can still do things like text similarity with it, but if you want to use spacy to create good word vectors, you should use a larger model such as `en_core_web_md` or `en_core_web_lg` since the small models are not known for accuracy. You can also use a variety of third-party models, but that is beyond the scope of this workshop. Again, choose the model that works best with your setup.  These will have to be loaded in before we can do any NLP."
